#### What is EMDR?

> Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychotherapy treatment that was originally designed to
> alleviate the distress associated with traumatic memories (Shapiro, 1989a, 1989b). [..] EMDR therapy facilitates the
> accessing and processing of traumatic memories and other adverse life experience to bring these to an adaptive
> resolution. After successful treatment with EMDR therapy, affective distress is relieved, negative beliefs are
> reformulated, and physiological arousal is reduced.
